## 文章内容

> In 1755 British writer Samuel Johnson published an acerbic letter to Lord Chesterfield rebuking his patron for neglecting and declining further support. Johnson’s rejection of his patron’s belated assistance has often been identified as a key moment in the history of publishing, marking the end of the culture of patronage. However, **patronage had been in   decline for 50 years, yet would survive, in attenuated form, for another 50**. Indeed, Johnson was in 1762 awarded a pension by the Crown — a subtle form of sponsorship, tantamount to state patronage. The importance of Johnson’s letter is not so much historical as emotional; it would become a touchstone for all who repudiated patrons and for all who embraced the laws of the marketplace.

## 结构分析

### 文章开头

文章前两句指出, 有观点认为: "SJ 喷 LC 的事件标志着 patronage 的结束". 随后文中出现 However, 由于前文是引用观点, 故 However 可能起到质疑的作用, 于是本句的核心方向应该是 "partonage 并没有结束". 后文中又出现了一个 yet, 表明该句中存在让步, 于是前半句应是对于引用观点的妥协, 结合语义, 可理解为 "partonage 虽然在变弱". 后半句显然与引用观点意思相反, 应为 "partonage 还没有结束". 

到这里, 文章已经抛出了一个观点, 文章的大概走势是:

> 有人认为 SJ 喷 LC 的事件标志着 patronage 的结束, 但实际上, 尽管 patronage 削弱了, 却没有结束.

按照常理, 下文应该对作者自己的观点进行展开.

### 后文展开

下文首先出现的是 indeed, 考虑语义, indeed 意为"确实", 不改变文章的观点方向, 故下文的意思仍应该是"partonage 没有结束", 结合 "tantamount to state patronage", 可知该句确实表明了类似的意思. 最后一句仍然是作者自己观点的展开, "not so much ... as ..." 指出 SJ 喷 LC 的事件, 在 emotional 方面的重要性要大于 historical 方面的重要性, 实际上也是在说这件事不能标志着 patronage 的结束.

### 整体结构

总体看来, 这篇文章的核心意思就是上文提到的走势, 而核心的两句话就是:

> Johnson’s rejection of his patron’s belated assistance has often been identified as a key moment in the history of publishing, marking the end of the culture of patronage. However, patronage had been in   decline for 50 years, yet would survive, in attenuated form, for another 50.
许多人认为 SJ 喷 LC 标志着 patronage 的结束, 但实际上并没有.

## 问题分析

### 问题一

首先从加粗句出发考虑, 涉及到的就是 however 的功能. 由以上的分析, 该句的功能为质疑前文的引用观点, 故可以如下设计正确选项:

1. Present a view that chanllenges a understanding of Johnson’s rejection of his patron’s belated assistance.
2. Outline an opposing interpretation of Johnson’s rejection of his patron’s belated assistance.
3. Qualify the declaration that Johnson’s rejection was the end of patronage.
4. ......

事实上, 原题目如下: 

> Which of the following best describes the function of the highlighted sentence in the context of the passage as a whole?
　　A. It points out the <del> most obvious</del> implications of Johnson’s letter to his patron
　　B. It suggests a <del>motivation</del> for Johnson’s rejection of Chesterfield’s patronage
　　**C**. It provides information that qualifies the assertion that Johnson’s letter sharply defined the end of a publishing era
　　D. It provides a possible <del>defense</del> for Chesterfield’s alleged neglect of Johnson
　　E. It refutes the notion that <del>patrons are found primarily among the nobility</del>

根据以上分析, 本题应选择 C.

### 问题二

文章的另一道题目是针对 1762 的事件 (Indeed, Johnson was in 1762 awarded a pension by the Crown — a subtle form of sponsorship, tantamount to state patronage) 提出的.

这句话是对作者自己观点的展开, 所以从功能上来就是对自己观点的加强, 很容易设计出如下的正确选项:

1. Support that Johnson’s rejection was not the end of patronage.

原题目如下:


> The author of the passage mentions Johnson’s 1762 pension award in order to
　　A：Reveal that Johnson remained consistent in his rebuke of Lord Chesterfield well after 1755
　　B：Provide evidence for a general trend in the later half of the eighteenth century of private patronage’s being replaced by state sponsorship
　　C：Situated the debate over the end of patronage within the wider realm of eighteenth-century economic history
　　D：Suggest that Johnson’s letter to Chesterfield was noticed by the crown only years after it was published
　　**E**：Emphasize that patronage still helped support Johnson’s writing after his letter to chesterfield

根据以上分析, 本题最合适的选项应为 E 选项. 值得注意的是 C 选项中 debate 一词的使用. Debate 的存在必然是有两派对立的引用观点, 否则不足以构成 debate. 注意作者观点与引用观点的对立并不算做 debate, 因为从作者的角度出发, 自己的观点一定是正确的, 不存在争论的必要.
