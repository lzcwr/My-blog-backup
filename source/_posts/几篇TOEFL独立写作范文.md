## 第一篇

In such a competitive society with ceaseless changes, there is a heated debate of the most fundamental factor of keeping close bond with people we love. Obviously, opinions vary from person to person in accordance with their inner preference. After a scrupulous assessment, I would render my support to spending time with them as much as possible.

To begin with, regarding the potential harm brought by being apart from the closest people, to say that moving far away is crucial for everyone to attach importance to valuable relationships is an exaggeration. Admittedly, whenever we step into a totally unfamiliar cultural background, it is likely that we would suffer in nostalgia and feel it hard to adapt to new environment immediately, which allows us to realize the indispensable role they play in our life. However, when analyzing this issue from an objective angle, we would find that the benefits caused by getting away from our parents are dwarfed by its negative influences. Even if the technological development enables us to keep in touch with our friends and families across a long distance, there are still emotional feelings and genuine expressions that cannot be discerned by others through the Internet.

In addition, compared with living in a great distance, spending time together provides a greater opportunity for us to enhance our mutual relationship much more effectively. Living in a fast paced society, young generation has been suffered overwhelming pressure from daily work and intensive study, which means that hardly can they squeeze time to accompany their families and friends. As a result, they will definitely treasure the scarce chance of holiday to have fun with their beloved friends and relatives. For instance, in Spring Festival in China, which is one of the most grandeur festivals for Chinese people, not only will people set off firecrackers to celebrate the important moment, but also they can share the latest information with each other and enjoy the harmonious atmosphere together. Consequently, it would benefit their relationship in the long run.

Last but not least, living with our close friends or families together paves a good way for us to give them cares and unconditioned help, so that we would not regret for not standing besides them in their darkest time. Numerous people post their regretful comments on Facebook because of their families death and their absence in their tough times. There is no denying that facing challenges together and forming a unity fortress are the most effective ways to establish the solid relationships in everyone's life. Since during the process of figuring out best solutions, we are likely to stand in others shoes to analyze problems and get deeper understanding of others. Generally speaking, people tend to cherish those friends who lend them a hand whenever they are stuck in dilemma.

In conclusion, considering the details mentioned above, it is a better choice for us to take time to accompany people who are important to us, instead of being far away from them. (498)

## 第二篇

独立写作题目：Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Workers would be much happier if they are doing different types of tasks at the same time than doing the same task. 

范文立场选择：Disagree

### Opening (60-100 Words)

#### Intro

Reasonable schedule arrangement and patient handling of each task demonstrate a person’s overall potential in his career. Especially in such a society with intensive competition, working pressures urge employees to devote much to the fulfillment of numerous projects. Therefore, some people would like to do several projects at a time for adjusting to a stressful working condition. 

#### Thesis

However, as far as I am concerned, finishing one task completely then to another should be more efficient because attentiveness is crucial to the performance of any projects. 

### Body (120-150 Words)

#### Topic

Last but not least, the focus of attention determines the final result of a project and is immediately related to working quality.

#### State

Doing several projects at the same time might divert attentiveness and may also undermine the general progress subsequently.

#### e.g.

To illustrate, in the field of architecture which I am majoring in, there is sufficient evidence to show that treating each progress, from scheme design to construction documentation, with attention continually might keep each step more efficient and prepare more fruitful outcomes in the upcoming phase. In other words, it is more reliable for an architect to finish one design and then proceed to the next as well as an unnecessary mix-up of various programs can be a drag on the whole plan. 

#### Close

It is no exaggeration to say that stopping one temporarily and changing to others might incur some undesirable accidents.

## 第三篇

Facing the fierce competition in modern society, the pursuit for the success has been the essence of the education. There are multiple choices to promote students' academic performance and accomplish final goals for students. Personally speaking, I would regard receiving support from families and friends as the most important element to be an elite.

First and foremost, modern society has witnessed that the career of private tutorship is developing at an alarming rate recently. Admittedly, knowledgeable advisors enable students to enlarge their knowledge base. However, this solution should be not considered as a wise choice. After all, parents and friends are the ones who know us best, because they have experienced every moment of our life with us. No matter what dilemma students are trapped in, it is their closest friends and families who are able to render solid support and lead them step out of woods. What's more, considering the crucial role played by parents and friends, hiring private advisors would turn out to be a huge drain of parents' money. 

In addition, it is admitted that attending high school is an imperative factor, which defines students' educational background and shapes their value. However, it is less rigorous to say that high school education holds the key to accomplish one's dream. Tracing back to our childhood, whenever we were stuck in a disappointed situation, only if our parents spotted our anomaly, there is no doubt that they would reach out to us and have a deep conversation with us. All they want to do was to encourage us to step out of the shade with a positive attitude and embrace the bright life bravely. Comparatively speaking, high school teachers are only aiming at the promotion of students' grades. Hardly can they teach students in accordance with their aptitude.

Last but not least, unconditional support of our families and friends constitutes the steppingstone towards further achievement. No one can substitute their imperative position in our life. For instance, after graduation from high school, not until I packed up my baggage and went abroad for study did I realize how important it is to master fundamental skills, such as financial management, car maintenance and cooking by myself, all of which are taught by my mother. Also, living in a foreign and unfamiliar environment is a huge challenge faced by international students, including me. However, in the darkest and hardest time, my friends always make video call through the convenient Internet, which enables me to receive their warm greetings and erase the severe nostalgia. It is because of their love that I have enough strength and faith to rise above the obstacles. 

In conclusion, with respect to the most effective factor of success, nothing can be compared with the generous love and care from our families and beloved friends. (467)
